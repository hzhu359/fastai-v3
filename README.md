# [Instrument Identifier!](https://instrumentpredictor.onrender.com/) From the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) [Render](https://render.com) guide.

This webapp was created from the [fast.ai v3 curriculum](https://course.fast.ai) from Lessons 2 and 3.

Input an image of a cello or violin (or an image of anything!) and this model (based on ResNet34) will try its best to identify what instrument it is.

Thanks to Jeremy Howard and the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) team!
